**Question**

> In your own words, explain the essential differences between `props` and `state` in React. Which is immutable or read-only, and which changes? Discuss the answer with your mentor.

A: Props are short for properties, and the props of a component are immutable or unchangeable. They are read-only. Props being immutable are what empower the one way data flow and simplicity of React. State is the state of the component, and it does change. State allows you to define different states or changes of a component depending on various factors that would trigger a change in the user interface including user input.
